## üîë Getting Your API Key

This project uses Google's Generative AI models through Genkit. To run the application, you need a Google AI API key.

1.  Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your free API key.
2.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of this project.
3.  Inside the `.env` file, add your API key like this:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Servers

You need to run two separate processes in parallel: the Next.js web application and the Genkit AI flow server.

**Terminal 1: Start the Next.js App**

This command starts the web interface.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

**Terminal 2: Start the Genkit AI Server**

This command starts the server that handles the AI generation logic.

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

This server runs in watch mode, so it will automatically restart if you make changes to the AI flow files.

### 3. Start Creating!

With both servers running, open your browser to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002). You can now select your desired options and start generating story starters!
